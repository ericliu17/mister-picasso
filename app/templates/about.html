            I am here to paint your portrait in the style of some of my favorite painters (myself included of course).
        </p>

        <p>
            To generate your painting, I begin by using a VGG-16 pre-trained convolutional neural network.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using the high-level features of your image and the style image derived from this model, I calculate pixel-wise and patch-wise feature correlations between your image and the style image. These allow me to capture features like colors, shapes, and textures.
